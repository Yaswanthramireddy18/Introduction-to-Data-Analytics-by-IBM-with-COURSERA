## Final Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

As a final project, I applied everything I learned to a real-world challenge: **early detection of credit card fraud**.  

Credit card fraud today often involves stolen card credentials used online. My role was to analyze historical transaction data to identify suspicious patterns and recommend ways to detect fraud early.

**Key fraud indicators included:**
- Sudden spikes in transaction frequency  
- Transactions unusually higher than typical amounts  
- Bulk orders with slight item variations  
- Changes in delivery preferences (e.g., to PO Boxes)  
- IP addresses mismatched with billing location  

**Project approach:**
- Collected relevant data points: cardholder info, transactions, delivery details, location, device data  
- Cleaned and standardized the data  
- Analyzed patterns and anomalies signaling fraud  
- Created clear visualizations to communicate findings  

**Sample Project Questions & Answers:**

1. **Data points for fraud detection:**  
   - Cardholder details (name, card number, billing address)  
   - Transaction date, time, amount  
   - Delivery info (shipping address, delivery type)  
   - IP address and location match  
   - Device/browser information  

2. **Data issues impacting accuracy:**  
   - Missing values  
   - Incorrect or inconsistent data  
   - Unstandardized date/time formats  

3. **Anomalies indicating fraud:**  
   - Sudden increase in transaction frequency  
   - Bulk orders with minor variations  

4. **Takeaway from visualization:**  
   - The graph reveals unusual transaction patterns that could indicate fraud.  

5. **Type of analysis performed:**  
   - Descriptive analysis, focusing on understanding historical data
